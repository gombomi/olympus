        <h2>THE BIG THREE</h2>
        <p>ã€€The Big Three are the three most powerful gods among the Olympians - Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, the three sons of Kronos and Rhea. While the Big Three gods are the strongest, Zeus is stated to be the most powerful amongst his brothers on multiple occasions. After they had defeated their father with the help of their sisters (Hestia, Demeter and Hera), the Elder Cyclopes and the Hekatonkheires, the three brothers divided the universe between themselves and then drew lots to determine their domains: Zeus received the sky, the heavens, and authority over Mount Olympus, Poseidon received the seas, and Hades received the Underworld. Zeus commands the sky, lightning, kingship, honor, light (Roman form), and summon any weather conditions, Poseidon can manipulate water, storms, and earthquakes, Hades has dominion over the dead and undead, darkness, earth-related disasters, and metals and jewels.</p>
